This is my technical challenge


### Cloud wisdom

The goal of this exercise is to show you know-how provisioning the cloud.

Adjust the script you have from the previous part and re-use it, to simulate your local environment but now in AWS Cloud. 

Give us the instructions so we will be able to run it and have a fresh EC2 instance with the same components as part 1.

**Requirements**:

- Use your favorite cloud provision tool.
- The settings/configuration to be adjusted must be clearly documented.
- No human intervention during the process.
- Donâ€™t need to attach any domain or public address to serve the web app externally.
- The script must have a command or process to shut down all created resources in the cloud.
- HTTPS is not required
- Web app serving port must be 80.
